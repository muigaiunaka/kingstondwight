After graduation from the University of Massachusetts, Jordan spent 7 years in Internal Audit working for both Texas Instruments and GTE (now Verizon).  When it was time to reduce his travel commitments, Jordan became a Finance Manager at a global software company.  Eventually he decided that advising hiring managers on the recruitment/development/retention of talent was his real interest and he joined Kingston Dwight Associates in 1995.  Bilingual, and well traveled, Jordan always has an interest in international assignments. Active in the Institute of Internal Auditors (IAA), Jordan has spoken at numerous career advice forums.  He enjoys hiking, cooking and daily morning jogs.
