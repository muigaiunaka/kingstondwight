After graduating from Princeton University Mike started his business career in public accounting in Boston. He was subsequently recruited into recruiting. His penchant for analysis and conversation drew him into this consulting/advisory role. With more than 25 years experience, and a Principal at Kingston-Dwight Associates, Mike has managed retained search work nationally and regionally. Industries served include the broad spectrum of venture funded biopharma startups to textile, and traditional manufacturing, publicly-traded Fortune 500 companies.

Mike has served on the boards for our National Network Affiliations. Other interests have found Mike at Town Meeting in Needham, MA, in front of the camera at his local cable station, doing Zumba, and on the bike or in the pool prepping for yet another triathlon.
