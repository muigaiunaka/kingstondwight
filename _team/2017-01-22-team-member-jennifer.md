After receiving her MBA from Tulane University, Jennifer earned her CPA in public accounting.  She co- founded Kingston Dwight Associates after 5 years of experience with a national recruiting firm.  
Although the firm is based in Boston, her experience includes national search work serving a broad industry base: financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare.


In the last few years, Jennifer has followed her volunteer interests. With experience helping both senior citizens and students, Jennifer hosted 3 international students through the Eugene Kinasewich Fund.  She also started a Chapter of the National Aging in Place Council to assist senior citizens and their families with the challenges of the aging process.   Jennifer remains active with her alma maters, and has co- chaired her Boston College class reunions.
