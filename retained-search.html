A leadership or senior management hire is a big investment of resources, time and effort for an organization. Selecting a committed recruiting business partner to direct or drive this process enhances decision making, provides better access to desired talent and increases the chances of getting an accepted offer from your top choice. We suggest companies that are hiring a Vice President and in some instances, an important Director level role, select this recruiting approach.
